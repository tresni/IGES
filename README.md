# [IndieGala Giveaways][Giveaways] Enhancement Suite

## Description

Hides games in the [Giveaways][] that you already have. Infinite scroll of giveaways.  Quick access to giveaways (click the thunderbolt icon next to "Enter.")

Fixes profiles by sorting lost games to the bottom.  Makes the images in profile view clickable and gives the quick access view.

Quick access dynamically adjusts itself as you enter/leave giveaways.

Highlights games on your wishlist in the Giveaways view

Header scrolls with you as you move through infinite scroll.

Hyperlink URLs in the forums.

## Todo

* Show compatible OS (for Mac Users like me)
* Show info on mouse over such as list of giveaways
* Extend profile to show when giveaways are ending
* Quick access actions should adjust the page with the new information

Suggestions welcome.
